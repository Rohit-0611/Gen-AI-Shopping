# GenAI-Based Clothing Store Management System
## Overview
GenAI Clothing Store Management System is an innovative project that leverages Langchain and SQL to create an intelligent system for managing a clothing store. The integration of Langchain allows for prompt engineering, enabling the model to understand and respond effectively to user queries. Additionally, the system is connected to an SQL database, enhancing its capability to fetch and manage data related to the clothing store.

## Features
### Langchain Integration
Langchain, a powerful tool for prompt engineering, is seamlessly integrated into GenAI Clothing Store Management System. This ensures that the model can interpret and generate responses to a wide range of user inputs related to the clothing store management.

### SQL Database Connectivity
The system is connected to an SQL database to store and retrieve data related to the clothing store. This includes information on inventory, sales, customer details, and more. SQL queries are employed to interact with the database, allowing for efficient data management.

### Data Retrieval and Manipulation
GenAI Clothing Store Management System can execute SQL queries to fetch specific data from the database. This includes retrieving information about available stock, recent sales, customer preferences, and other relevant details. The system can also perform data manipulation tasks, such as updating stock levels or recording new transactions.

### LLM Model Fine-Tuning (Work in Progress)
The project is actively working on fine-tuning the Google Palm Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance its understanding of clothing store management-related queries. This will lead to more accurate and context-aware responses, improving the overall performance of the system.

## Getting Started
### Installation Guide
Before using GenAI Clothing Store Management System, the need of python is necessary (Jupyter for comfortable usage) and create a new virtual environment and download the required libaries from the "requirements.txt" and get your own Google PaLM API Key from the [Website](https://makersuite.google.com/)

### Usage Instructions
Learn how to interact with the system, execute SQL queries, and make the most of its capabilities. Detailed usage instructions, code examples, and prompts can be found in the Usage Instructions section.

## Roadmap
The development roadmap for GenAI Clothing Store Management System includes the following enhancements:

1. **LLM Model Fine-Tuning**: Continuously improve the LLM model's understanding of clothing store management queries through fine-tuning.
2. **Advanced Data Analytics**: Introduce features for more in-depth data analysis, including sales trends, customer behavior patterns, and inventory forecasting.
3. **User Access Control**: Implement user access control to ensure secure and authorized access to different functionalities within the system.
4. **Integration with E-commerce Platforms**: Explore the possibility of integrating the system with e-commerce platforms for seamless online and offline store management.
